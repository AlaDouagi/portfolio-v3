#Now
#### The answer to "What are you upto these days?"

I have been very busy lately and am finding it hard to focus on important things. I had been procrastinating since months on building this personal site but I finally decided to do it. So, by the time you read this page, I would still be working on this site.

I'm also trying to start learning Rust and get into Mobile App Development using React Native. But to be honest, I'm just procrastinating on these things. I hope I start doing them after finishing my personal site.

I've also started gaming after years (lol), and I like it. I'm playing a pc game called Valorant and it's amazing and a very good way for me to spend my free time (don't worry - I touch grass).

Lately, I haven't watched anything new as I spend that time playing Valorant. I'm going to start my college finally in November hopefully and this is the reason I've been busy these days.
